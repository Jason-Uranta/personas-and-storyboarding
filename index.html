      <p>
        One of the most importance considerations to think about whenever you 
        implement a new component or modifiy an exsiting one is how your component <br>
        will perform in terms of learnablilty, memorablilty, and efficiency.
        <br>
        <br>
        Learnablilty refers to how learnable an element/component is for a new 
        user who may not have any prior experience with it. Mmemorablilty refers <br>
        to how easy it is for user to remember how to use and navigate the 
        element at hand. For both of these considerations, the intuitive nature <br>
        and universal recongnition of the component and it's function play a big
        role. Lastly, efficiency refers to how quickly and easily a component can <br>
        comeplete its function once the user intracts with it.
        <br>
        <br>
        Let's see how the dropdown menus on the 3 website do in terms of these
        considerations:
      </p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Let Learnable, Memorable, and Efficient be represented by (L), (M), and (E) respectively.</th>

          <th><strong>Cool Math Games</strong></th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>What can the dropdown do?</th>

              <li>Hides features until the user deems them necessary (saving space) (E)</li>
              <li>Provides visual cues via arrows (M, L, E)</li>
              <li>Modifies the list of options to appear in the same scheme as UI (M, L, E)</li>
            </ul>
          </td>

            <ul>

              <li>When an item in a list is clicked, it opens a new page.</li>
              <li>The base state is white text on a brown background, which works well.</li>
              <li>The focus starts with headers and titles before going toward the smaller text and is fairly intuitive.</li>

            <ul>

      <p>
        Now, here is my interpretation of the possible states of the dropdown 
        menu when accesed though mouse and Keyboard interation. 
      </p>

      <h4> For ease of viewing, I'll using a states diagram to showcase this: </h4>
      <div id="staffGallery">
        <div class="imageContainer" style="width: 400px;">

        <li>An extra click confirmation state would allow those with low vision and cognitive disabilities to receive extra feedback to indicate the state change.</li>
        <li>This feature is fairly intuitive, so its learnability would be quite high as users use this new system.</li>
        <li>Its intuitive nature would also increase memorability, as ripple confirmation of interaction is small but memorable.</li>
        <li>Efficiency would remain unaffected by this change.</li>

      <h4>Dropdown Component for Keyboard User (Revised)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The main purpose of this component is to improve its efficiency.</li>
        <li>By offering a quicker way to the preferred menu item, you greatly decrease the time it takes to navigate the web page to the dropdown destination in mind.</li>
        <li>This feature is quite intuitive which means that learnability would be high.</li>
        <li>It’s useful in almost all scenarios involving a dropdown menu, making it memorable.</li>
      </ul>




      <h2>Final Reflection on Dropdown Menu Usability Accessibility</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The dropdown menu component's strengths come from its universal 
          familiarity and recognition that it’s gained from consistent use <br>
          throughout the internet. It’s very space-efficient and only expands 
          its menu options when needed. Keyboard access is easy to implement and <br>
          screen reader support works well for this component.
        </li>

        <li>Adding the click confirmation state enhances accessibility via the 
          immediate feedback the user is given when clicking on the menu.  From <br>
          the visual ripple to a possible auditory cue to confirm the user’s 
          actions, the usability of the component improves greatly.
        </li>
        <li>This resolves the “mismatch” between how those with motor and/or 
          visual impairments can interact with technology and how they are <br>
          expected to interact by developers. Now they can rest easy knowing 
          that their click was successful rather than second-guessing their <br>
          actions if the dropdown menu is slow to render.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Today, using a mouse to navigate buttons and components on the internet 
        has become standard practice. As a result, when we think of maximizing <br> 
        accessibility a lot of the effort UX engineers put into making progress 
        in this area goes towards that form of interaction, leaving others neglected. <br> 
        An example of this can be seen in the universal design of the mouse and 
        contrast considerations for aesthetic purposes and those with impaired vision. <br> 
        The black center with a white outline with a thick yet subtle shadow points 
        to the developers considering how the mouse would look as it traversed a <br> 
        page with any combination of colors. Another example that showcases other 
        neglected components can be seen with keyboard interaction and how certain <br> 
        components aren’t accessible the way they would be via mouse. This can be 
        seen in an unintuitive focus order of elements or in some clickable elements <br> 
        being skipped entirely by the keyboard, leaving fewer options for those 
        who can’t rely on other forms of interaction.
