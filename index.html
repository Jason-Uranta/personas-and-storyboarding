      <h1>Personas and Storyboarding: Vending Machines</h1>
      <h3>
        I've decided to make the vending machine the focal point for my analysis
         of public interfaces that require “persona” consideration.

    <h4> Why Vending Machines? </h4>
      <div id="staffGallery">

    <p> 
    The vending machine interface serves the role of allowing 
    individuals to access their options of convenient food or drink 
    items and allowing them to pay via cash or card to acquire the 
    available item of their choosing. There is a glass wall that allows 
    you to see all available options and their ID number, a pin pad to 
    allow the user to enter the ID for any item shown, an analog screen 
    that shows how much an entered ID's item costs, a card reader acting 
    as a payment method for the item chosen, and a red cancel button to 
    cancel the purchase and avoid getting your card charged. This makes 
    the vending machine a great interface to analyze as a public interface
    and allows us to build a basis for possible personas of users of 
    this interface quite easily.

    <h2> Interviews!</h2>
    <h4> I conducted 3 short interviews with active vending machines users!</h4>

    <p> Here are the questions asked! </p>
    <ol>
      <li>What made you decide to use the vending machine today? Were there other
         options you considered? (Open-ended)</li>
      <li>What goal did you have in mind when using this machine? (Open-ended)</li>
      <li> Before approaching the vending machine, how certain were you about what
         item you wanted? (Very certain, slightly <br> certain, neutral, slightly 
         uncertain, very uncertain)</li>
      <li>Please tell me about how you went about deciding which item you wanted
         from the machine. (Open-ended)</li>
      <li>On a scale from 1-5, how easy or difficult was it to use the vending 
        machine? (1 is very easy and 5 is very hard)</li>
      <li> Did you experience any difficulties when using the vending machine? 
        (Yes or no) If so, what were they?  (Open-ended)</li>
    </ol>

    <h3> Person #1</h3>
    <h4>Here are some observations I made:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Person 1 walked up to the vending machine, immediately swipe their 
        card, entered an id, and took their item to go.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <h4>Here are Person #1's the responses to the interview questions:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>This person was on a study break and wanted a sweet treat before going
         back to work. Going to a dining hall from the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. <br>
         Library (the Rock) would have taken too much time and they didn't want 
         a full meal, just a snack.</li>
      <li>The goal was to get Sour Patch Watermelon gummies as they usually do 
        and eat them while watching a YouTube video.</li>
      <li>Slightly certain.</li>
      <li>This person usually gets Sour Patch Gummies from the Rock so there 
        wasn't much of an internal debate. Most likely a habit they have.</li>
      <li>Two.</li>
      <li>Yes. Sometimes the card reader doesn't work right on the first swipe 
        so they tend to start off with a double swipe motion but not much else <br>
        is problematic.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3> Person #2</h3>
    <h4>Here are some observations I made:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Person 2 walked up to the vending machine and stared at all the items
        for about a minute. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Their eyes darted from one item to the next and back to the same few items. 
      </li>
      <li>
        After, they swiped their card and entered for an item. They then 
        entered an ID for another item and took both from the food cubby. 
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Here are Person #2's the responses to the interview questions:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        This person had a craving but for nothing specific. The dining halls 
        were another option, but it was too cold and too much effort to walk <br>
        there.
      </li>
      <li>
        They wanted to snack on something to satisfy their craving.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slightly uncertain.
      </li>
      <li>
        They were unsure about what to get since they couldn’t find the cookies
         that they liked, so they went back and forth between the Big KitKat and <br>
         another brand of cookies. After a while, they decided to just get both.
      </li>
      <li>
        Two.
      </li>
      <li>
        Yes. The machine itself is fine, but they tend to be indecisive.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br>

    <h3> Person #3</h3>
    <h4>Here are some observations I made:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Like Person 1, Person 3 walked up to the vending machine, immediately 
        swipe their card, entered an ID, and took their item to go.
      </li>
      <li>
        This person was a man of little words and did not seem like they wanted 
        to be interviewed to be honest.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Here are Person #3's the responses to the interview questions:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>They wanted potato chips.</li>
      <li>No.</li>
      <li>To get potato chips.</li>
      <li>Very certain.</li>
      <li>They already knew what type of chips the machine had and what they 
        wanted to get.</li>
      <li>One. No.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2> Persona Analysis Time!</h2>
  <h4> 
    Based off of the 3 people I interviewed I made two personas to represent 
    the archetypes of people who use vending machines.

    I decided to make a storyboard to illistrate the series of events a user 
    like Assertive Anthony may go through when using the vending machine interface.
